# Sherlock Holmes
Sherlock Holmes is the world's greatest detective. Originally a figure invented by
Sir Arthur Conan Doyle he is now present in all types of media, including comics, computer
games, Movies, and fan-written fiction. His special ability is the art of deduction. His bestfriend and sidekick is Dr Watson. Originally a rather flat and stupid character, he gained more depth in most modern adaptations of the story, including in the BBC drama 'Sherlock'.
